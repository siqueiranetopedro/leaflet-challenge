USGS Earthquake Data Visualization Challenge

Overview

Welcome to the USGS Earthquake Data Visualization Challenge! In this project, we aim to create a set of tools that will empower the United States Geological Survey (USGS) to effectively communicate their extensive earthquake data. As stewards of scientific information about natural hazards, ecosystems, and environmental health, the USGS plays a crucial role in educating the public and informing government organizations about the challenges our planet faces.

Project Objective

The primary objective of this challenge is to develop a robust and user-friendly visualization solution for USGS earthquake data. The USGS collects vast amounts of data from global seismic activities daily, and there is a pressing need for a meaningful and accessible way to present this information. By creating effective visualization tools, we aim to enhance public understanding and facilitate communication with government organizations to address critical issues related to earthquakes, climate change, and land-use impacts.# leaflet-challenge
